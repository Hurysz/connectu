## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#293462), evoking trust, stability, and knowledge which is fitting for a university platform.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E0F2F7), maintains a clean and professional look with a subtle tint.
- Accent color: Purple (#6C5B7B), which will provide a sophisticated contrast.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for a modern, tech-oriented look, especially well-suited for a younger student demographic.
- Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif will pair with Space Grotesk to guarantee legibility for the larger bodies of text such as chat and resources.
- Use clear and modern icons for navigation and feature representation. Emojis and icons for each screen are stored locally.
- Maintain a clean, intuitive layout with a clear navigation menu for easy access to different sections.
